v0.0.2
------

Most of these changes are in preparation for a client/server architecture.

 * Make text and metaphone indices handle Unicode strings better.

 * Add speed benchmarks.

 * Defer actual searching until results are needed.

 * Implement `Search#to_hash`. (eventually, .load_hash too)

 * Implement `Search#inspect`.

 * Allow performing searches from hashes. This hash can be generated by
   `Search#to_hash`. (`Model.ion.search { 'gate' => 'any', 'searches' => ... }`)

 * Implement an Ion::Wrapper class so that your app does not need to be
   loaded to perform searches.

v0.0.1 -- Feb 13, 2011

 * Initial release.
